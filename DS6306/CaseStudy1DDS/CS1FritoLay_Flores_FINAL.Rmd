### Case Study 1 - Frito Lay Attrition Data -
## Description: DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics has been hired by Frito Lay to identify factors related to employee attrition.  They aim to predict employee attrition in order to identify those employees who may be more likely to leave the company as well as identifying factors that are related to attrition so that they can best reduce the probability of attrition where desired. 

# The company has also indicated that they would like for you to build a model(s) to predict attrition and be able to measure the cost or savings impact of your model(s).  Specifically, they have identified, based on this article and prior research that it costs between 50% and 400% of the employeeâ€™s salary to recruit a replacement for someone who has left the company.  Additionally, they have estimated that if they give extra attention or incentives to employees that are about to leave they may be able to keep them from leaving.  Frito Lay has estimated the cost of these incentives to be $200 per employee.  These numbers can be used to help you estimate how much money a particular model could help save the company.  

# Frito Lay has provided a dataset (CaseStudy1-data.csv) to build your models and to do a data analysis to identify factors that lead to attrition.  You should identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover (backed up by evidence provided by analysis). Note: your model(s) may have more than three variables / features, we just want to specifically identify the top three most important. You may be able to / find it useful to create derived attributes/variables/features. 

# The business is also interested in learning about any other interesting trends and/or observations from your analysis. The analysis should be backed up by robust experimentation and appropriate visualization. Experiments and analysis must be conducted in R. You will also be asked to build a model to predict attrition.
